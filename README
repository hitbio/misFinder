misFinder- An unbiased mis-assembly identification tool
============================


misFinder is a tool that aims to identify the assembly errors with high accuracy in an unbiased way and correct these errors at their mis-assembled positions to improve the assembly accuracy for downstream analysis. It combines the information of reference (or close related reference) genome and aligned paired-end reads to the assembled sequence. Structure variation and mis-assembly can be detected by comparing the reference genome and assembled sequence. Different types of assembly errors can then be distinguished from the mis-assembled sequences by analyzing the aligned paired-end reads using multiple features derived from coverage and consistence of insert distance to obtain high confident error calls.

The binary file and source code will be released soon.


Thanks for enjoying it.
